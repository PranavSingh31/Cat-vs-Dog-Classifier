# Cat-vs-Dog-Classifier

## 1. Introduction
Dog vs Cat Classifier is one of the most well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) problem . Depending on the settings, this project will classify an image as either dog or cat.

### Convolutional Neural Network
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or convnet) is a subset of machine learning. It is one of several types of artificial neural networks utilised for diverse applications and data types. A CNN is a type of network design for deep learning algorithms that is primarily utilised for image recognition and pixel data processing applications. The CNN model used in this project is Mobilenetv2 that is 53-layer deep and as has been trained over million of times on Imagenet dataset.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.
